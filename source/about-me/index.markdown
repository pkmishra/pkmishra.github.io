I am Pradeep Kumar Mishra a.k.a. PK. I love building simple &amp; scalable internet products and that&rsquo;s where I have spent most of my last 10 years (See <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/pradeepmishra">my LinkedIn profile</a> for more details). While I am not working I like watching movies/television series and consuming lot of startup space information through various blogs and developer community. Watch this space for my musings on technology, people, process and related stuff.</p>
